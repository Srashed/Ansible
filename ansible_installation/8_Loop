 Loop usesage to itrate number of items. Loop can be used with list of items or array of items
 for example if you want to create number of users for a system you can use loop as
 
 -
  name: create users
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - user: name='{{ item }}'    state=present
      loop:
        - user1
        - user2
        - user3
        - userN
      
 But jow can we use this with condition like 
 user = joe
 uid = 1010
 
 
  -
  name: create users
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - user: name='{{ item.name }}'    state=present  uid= '{{ item.uid }}'
      loop:
        - name: user1
          uid: 1010
        - name: user2
          uid: 1011
        - name: userN
          uid: 1012
 
 
 Another way of using loop is With_* 
 
 Syntax with_items:
 there are number of with_* derevitatives. This are modified script

 EXamples: 
 
 Write ansible script to print name of listed fruits
 
 
 - name: 'print list of fruits'
   hosts: localhost
   vars:
     fruits:
        - apple
        - banana
        - grapes
        - orange
   tasks:
     - 
        command: 'echo "{{ item }}" '
        with_items: '{{ fruits }}'
        

Example 2:
    We are attempting to install multiple packages using yum module.
    
- 
  name: 'Install required packages'
  hosts: localhost
  vars:
     packages:
        - httpd
        - binutils
        - glibc
        - ksh
        - libaio
        - gcc
        - make
        - nodejs
  tasks:
    -  
       yum:
          name: '{{ item }}'
          state: present
       with_items: '{{ packages }}'
