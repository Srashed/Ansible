 Loop usesage to itrate number of items. Loop can be used with list of items or array of items
 for example if you want to create number of users for a system you can use loop as
 
 -
  name: create users
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - user: name='{{ item }}'    state=present
      loop:
        - user1
        - user2
        - user3
        - userN
      
 But jow can we use this with condition like 
 user = joe
 uid = 1010
 
 
  -
  name: create users
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - user: name='{{ item.name }}'    state=present  uid= '{{ item.uid }}'
      loop:
        - name: user1
          uid: 1010
        - name: user2
          uid: 1011
        - name: userN
          uid: 1012
 
 
 Another way of using loop is With_* 
 
 Syntax with_items:
 there are number of with_* derevitatives. This are modified script
